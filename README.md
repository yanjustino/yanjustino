I am a dedicated professional who consistently strives to integrate the best software engineering practices into my work. With over two decades of experience, I have had the privilege of contributing to the development of robust corporate software solutions. Currently, I serve as a Senior Software Engineer at Itaú Unibanco, where I play a role in crafting service-oriented financial solutions.

In addition to my industry experience, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at CESAR SCHOOL, which allows me to further deepen my understanding of advanced software engineering concepts. Alongside this academic pursuit, I obtained a master's degree in Software Engineering from the graduate program at the Metrópole Digital Institute (IMD) / UFRN. These academic endeavors have enriched my practical insights and equipped me to approach challenges with a more comprehensive perspective.

Please feel free to get in touch with me to explore potential areas of collaboration in the field of software engineering, technology, and beyond.
